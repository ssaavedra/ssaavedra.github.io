This is probably yet-another rant about how privacy is important and
why everything on the Internet is broken, as it assumes it can do
anything with you. This stems in part from the fact that programmers
don't usually have a background in law, and they usually don't even
care.

One of the most preeminent broken examples of the Internet is
privacy. Everything on the Internet assumes that it can do anything it
wants with your data, for the sake of improving a service, or for the
sake of earning money on mining you.
