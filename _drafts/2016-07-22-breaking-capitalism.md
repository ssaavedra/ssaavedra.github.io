I need to put much more thoughts into these words, but let’s have a preliminary.

After watching every move from most tech companies, it is obvious at least to realize that a lot of their decisions affect our daily lives. We’ve already inverted the power balance between government and corporations, and it seems that corporations now have the power to destabilize such balance even further. So much so that some companies are already taking care of many previously publicly-owned services. This is not a phenomenon directly attached to tech companies, and has been happening through the capital history. For example, taxi drivers used to be self-employed but now many taxi corporations exist which pay for the licenses and the salaries as their cost has become exceedingly expensive for people to pay. However, most capital is these days been funneled through investment towards tech companies, so it bears no surprise that, by having the most expending capabilities, they now have their fair share of control. Also, tech is making much more efficient the capitalist process and such becoming an even greater entity of control.

One of the problems with these approaches to control and development of societies is that they become less democratic, because those in power are so due to them holding equity over corporations, instead of having been democratically elected.

Of course losing control over the State means losing power over our own future, and thus probably leading those outside the sphere of influence to just be pawns in a game, more or less similar (in the control structure) as many have been in dictatorships through history.

However, there is one remarkable change, and that is that nowadays we have created so much wealth through all the discoveries and achievements we have made in the latest years that even the poorest are not as poor as they were in the past.

It is true, according to World Bank figures, that we have decreased the number of people living in “extreme poverty” (for the WB definition of extreme poverty) and we have also reduced the number of poor people, according to the standards used by the World Bank in such matter. [TODO: put reference links here]

However, it is also true that the inequality gap has been getting broader. This means that wealthy people (and especially very wealthy people) are extremely wealthier than they would have been in the past, both in absolute figures and with respect to the general population.

So Silicon Valley is trying to sell us on an idea that everyone can get much more than they may be having, but that has already been happening through history, despite the inequality gap getting this large.

In fact, this idea would only make a huge difference for corporations, and specifically those who will continue to trade influence over the population.

We can even be going towards some kind of Matrix that we will eventually accept, if enough control is carefully directed to psychologically embrace the idea of living in a fake world.

And all of this is already happening, without much we can do about it.

# What enables them

Corporations are, in general, much more powerful than individuals. Through some laws, we have given these human-made conceptions the definition itself of persons (at least in so many developed jurisdictions, they are Legal persons, even if they are not physical ones). In many contexts that alone is very powerful: foreign-country corporations usually hold more rights than undocumented physical persons from anywhere in the world.

But tackling this problem would be a very long series of postings by itself, so let’s just leave that point for the moment.

The game-changing concept is, of course, that legal persons are immortal. Many, having been established before our current generation was even born, could hold on to a structure of power that we cannot compete with, in our limited time-frame of existence.

By living for several generations’ worth of physical persons, a corporation can create power structures and shape them as the times see fit, thus influencing the regulatory power structures that should be in place to prevent that power from taking over.

# How we can take over

I propose a blueprint to establish a democratically-owned infrastructure in a way that is not radically novel, but that would, at least, compete in interesting opportunities with them.

I propose building a democratically-sustained entity to hold the wealth that we, as citizens, need to develop and innovate in public services.

This corporation would raise funds via crowd-funding to compete in public services creation and democratization. The projects which would take place would be elected democratically by the shareholders. However, voting rights will be limited by person, and not by shares. In such a way that shares of the C (for Citizen) class will bear 1M voting rights, and ordinary shares bear only 1 voting right each. Shares of the C class will not be ordinarily trade-able.

Another way of articulating this is by using the Triodos approach, and having a Foundation (a Stirling in Dutch law) that would hold all shares of the corporation and distribute voting rights to the Foundation Members. Everyone should be enabled to be a Foundation Member, for a monthly price, which would contribute to the crowd-funding efforts, and could be thought of as the tax for being a citizen in this corporation-controlled idea.

This corporation would be governed by the private-corporations law, because it is not State-controlled, but as its members hold vote in the process of what to do (in the boundaries of public services) it is in the broader (non-legal) meaning, a truly public corporation.

The problem is still that money can fluctuate and regulation can happen that may mitigate the advances that we can do here, so a new corporation-issued form of money is also in order. This currency, based on Monero tokens, would be auditable by the corporation, so that transactions involving it could be properly taxed when calculating Income Tax, and taxes could be properly adjusted according to the voting rights of all members and the money in the Corporation’s Reserve.

This is of course a naïve approach, so we’d need to first take measures to harden legally the possibility of a take-down to a non-democratic participation, or the degeneration of the participatory model into something oligarchic.

I’m looking for ideas on how we could do this.
