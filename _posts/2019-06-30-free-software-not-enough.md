# Mindmap
* Part of FSM for a good part of life
** Donated
*** Time
*** Code
*** Money
** Advocated
*** Talks
*** Workshops
** Inspired others
* At some point, realise FSM is a political movement
** It is political indeed: collectively aim for things
** Collectives in society aiming in public for things: politics
** Lately, connected dots: roots in anarchocapitalism
*** Nice for some things: require all the liberties
*** Bad for some others: what about things we don't want?
*** No problem: halo of neutrality. Tech is neutral.
*** But is it?
*** It's not.
*** Examples on why it's not.
* Economy
** No need to think on conspiracy theorist and benevolent/malevolent actor dichotomy.
** The market works in short-term strikes, even if long-term bad idea
** Huge short-term incentives for actions that hurt society long-term
*** Such as mass-surveillance
*** Data accumulation
*** Global profiling
*** Loss of diversity and democracy
** We need incentives against that, how?
* Politics
** We live in the game of economics, but economics are regulated by laws.
** Laws can make things more efficient in the market, and align society with economy.
** E.g., climate change.
*** Unregulated, contamination leads to short-term profit (no money to waste mgmt)
*** Regulated, contamination leads to short-term losses (and longer-term!)
*** Regulation here => Long-term viability alignment with our life
** E.g., car accidents
*** Unregulated, cars could break down and lead to less costs for manufacturers
*** Regulated, cars don't usually kill people due to malfunction
*** Regulation => Long-term approach of society and enterprise
** We need to regulate technology
** However, regulation always comes *after* the thing to regulate
*** First, because otherwise there is no point in regulating things that don't exist
*** Second, because we can't really regulate until we know
*** However, that means that companies get frustraed
**** Their business may be shut-down for finding it against society
* We need actual politics for technology in a free society
** First, it's no longer about just software anymore
** We have patents for describing technology advancements
** We have open source for describing software
** We have open desing for describing PCBs
** But we don't have a framework for usage
*** Do we want our free software to be used in war crimes?
*** Or in mass surveillance?
*** Do we want our free software to enable/enhance mass surveillance?
*** Free software still enables and includes telemetry and facilities to call home and spy on you
* Can of worms
** I believe most FSM defenders will also agree that mass surveillance is the next problem to tackle
** "Software for a Free Society Movement" (S4FSM) is probably a better acryonym for this than FSM.
** Much more nuanced than the "four laws"
*** Usage? Modification? Redistribution? Red. of mod.?
*** Usage
**** We want to use it as end users, but we may want no economic incentives
**** We may want to allow modification to end users and for research purposes
***** but do we want to modify it to add monitoring/surveillance?
***** or to create software that is against our purposes?  (Is tech neutral again?)
**** Redistribution is probably fine while the former ones are respected
**** Redistribution of mods is likely fine too
**** However, we might just step by and ask ourselves if we would want redistribution capped
***** Might allow economic models that increase cooperation if this is restricted
***** E.g., force redistribution when copyright holders go bankrupt
***** but allow terms for exclusivity distribution on first 5 years
***** This could work like patents, but in the theoretically useful way
** My v0.1 definition of S4FSM
   Saavedra's Software for a Cooperative Society, version 0-beta1.

   1. Usage.
      1. Software is free to be used by any individual, without
         restriction of purpose, without implied guarantees.
      2. The sources of the software and the build systems required to
         create the packages need to be provided for scrutiny, and to
         allow replicability.
      3. Software is free to be used by any cooperative society, with
         the restrictions on purpose henceforth outlied, and without
         implied guarantees.
	 - The restrictions shall include any as outlied in the
           RESTRICTIONS document accompanying this license, if
           applicable. Modifications shall not reduce the content of
           the RESTRICTIONS file, and can only append to the end,
           including where does the original content of the file
           finish and what does the modification entail in
           restrictions.
   2. Software shall not be used for the principal use of surveillance.
   3. Technology that can be used to create surveillance profiles must
      be carefully protected and restricted from third-party
      access. An explicit guarantee with a civil responsability of
      10Mâ‚¬ per licensee is included by the software authors that
      surveillance will never be used for purposes outside improving
      the product, and always attending to data minimization and
      anonymization.
   4. Data retention systems are in place from the authors or
      authorized third-parties providing data collection in a way that
      enforces data to be only used for the accepted purposes.
   5. Mod.

I've been part of several pro- free software movements for a good part
of my life. I've donated code to the FSF and to the ASF, time and
volunteering to so many, including the FSFE, to GNOME, KDE and the
Wikimedia project, and money to at least Mandrake, Red Hat, FOSDEM,
GNOME, Python, the Wikimedia Foundation, and probably some others.

Not much, but what I could spare at the various moments in my life
where these projects came to have a great importance on my life.

My thoughts around the Free Software Movement could be summarized in
that I vaguely thought that it would undoubtedly lead to a better
society.

I'm no longer so sure about that statement today.

Don't get me wrong, I still think some kind of "Free Software"-alike
principles need to be abided by, and there is for sure some way to get
us to pursue a better society, but I think the Free Software
principles are now outdated and can't embrace the changes in paradigm
that the capitalistic model has been generating.

In particular, Free Software alone leaves too much room for the
receiver to do with such software.

The first liberty, of using a software without any usage restriction,
is itself problematic, because it assumes that technology is neutral,
and that it is of the implementor or user of that technology to abide
by morality and refrain themselves from using technology in a
malevolent way.

But now we know technology is not neutral, and the way itself in which
we (technologists) envision, design and create technology shapes the
future in ways that cannot be anticipated.

Technology is not neutral in the sense that we are constantly making
design choices about how to improve engagement, telemetry and ways of
making the user use our technology in the best way possible.

That is not malevolent *per se*, but when you apply that, e.g., to how
YouTube, by implementing AutoPlay (such a tiny feature!), increases
their watch-time by 55%, now you should be wandering whether that 55%
of time is more wasteful than if the user had already bounced from
watching videos.

Perhaps not, but we have never measured so, and we have never been
asked, as a society about that.
