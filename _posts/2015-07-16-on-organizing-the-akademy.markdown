Hi, fellows! I'm proud to say that this year [GPUL][gpul] is honoured
to host the Akademy 2015 with the
[Faculty of Computer Science in A Coruña][1] as our venue.

So, if you'll be in A Coruña, I'll be delighted to see you in the
venue and maybe buying us a T-shirt!

The entrance is free, but you should register at <https://conf.kde.org>
so that you are granted a badge to enter during the weekend.

This year I'm commited to handling volunteers, so you will most
probably see me a lot in the InfoDesk that we'll set up in the ground
floor, where all our team magic happens :P

It's been difficult at times, and arguing with people over the IRC on
whether things are OK or not are not always ideal, but I must say
about KDE that they're highly organized, and that they have lots of
tools already set up to aid us in mundane stuff, such as an etherpad
instance (which we use internally for storing todo lists and agendas),
a kanboard instance which holds our sort of "master" todo-list, and of
course, the prevalent wikis and mailing lists.

We were hoping to take the [fosdem-volunteers][2] app and give it a shot
for volunteer handling, but that's not happening for this edition
(ooooh), we'll have to do with the wiki and the IRC.

There are ideas on creating a Telegram group, although I still find
the IRC a bit more amenable. Shouldn't I?

I hope we have interesting things to tell once this is over ;)


Cheers,
Santiago.
